My name is Alice Ryhl. I am a software developer and mathematician, currently a
student at the Technical University of Denmark. I am one of the primary
maintainers of the widely used Rust library [Tokio]. Additionally, I work at
Google in the Android Security and Privacy team, where I enable other teams to
use Rust in Android.
