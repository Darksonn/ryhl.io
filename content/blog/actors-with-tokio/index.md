This article is about building actors with Tokio directly, without using any
actor libraries such as Actix. This turns out to be rather easy to do, however
there are some details you should be aware of:

 1. Where to put the `tokio::spawn` call.
 2. Struct with `run` method vs bare function.
 3. Handles to the actor.
 4. Backpressure and bounded channels.
 5. Graceful shutdown.

The techniques outlined in this article should work with any executor, but for
simplicity we will only talk about Tokio.  There is some overlap with the
[spawning] and [channel chapters] from the Tokio tutorial, and I recommend also
reading those chapters.

Before we can talk about how to write an actor, we need to know what an actor
is. The basic idea behind an actor is to spawn a self-contained task that
performs some job independently of other parts of the program. Typically these
actors communicate with the rest of the program through the use of message
passing channels. Since each actor runs independently, programs designed using
them are naturally parallel.

A common use-case of actors is to assign the actor exclusive ownership of some
resource you want to share, and then let other tasks access this resource
indirectly by talking to the actor. For example, if you are implementing a chat
server, you may spawn a task for each connection, and a master task that routes
chat messages between the other tasks. This is useful because the master task
can avoid having to deal with network IO, and the connection tasks can focus
exclusively on dealing with network IO.

## The Recipe

An actor is split into two parts: the task and the handle. The task is the
independently spawned Tokio task that actually performs the duties of the actor,
and the handle is a struct that allows you to communicate with the task.

Let's consider a simple actor. The actor internally stores a counter that is
used to obtain some sort of unique id. The basic structure of the actor would be
something like the following:
```rust
use tokio::sync::{oneshot, mpsc};

struct MyActor {
    receiver: mpsc::Receiver<ActorMessage>,
    next_id: u32,
}
enum ActorMessage {
    GetUniqueId {
        respond_to: oneshot::Sender<u32>,
    },
}

impl MyActor {
    fn new(receiver: mpsc::Receiver<ActorMessage>) -> Self {
        MyActor {
            receiver,
            next_id: 0,
        }
    }
    fn handle_message(&mut self, msg: ActorMessage) {
        match msg {
            ActorMessage::GetUniqueId { respond_to } => {
                self.next_id += 1;

                // The `let _ =` ignores any errors when sending.
                //
                // This can happen if the `select!` macro is used
                // to cancel waiting for the response.
                let _ = respond_to.send(self.next_id);
            },
        }
    }
}

async fn run_my_actor(mut actor: MyActor) {
    while let Some(msg) = actor.receiver.recv().await {
        actor.handle_message(msg);
    }
}
```
Now that we have the actor itself, we also need a handle to the actor. A handle
is an object that other pieces of code can use to talk to the actor, and is also
what keeps the actor alive.

The handle will look like this:
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct MyActorHandle {
    sender: mpsc::Sender<ActorMessage>,
}

impl MyActorHandle {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel(8);
        let actor = MyActor::new(receiver);
        tokio::spawn(run_my_actor(actor));

        Self { sender }
    }

    pub async fn get_unique_id(&self) -> u32 {
        let (send, recv) = oneshot::channel();
        let msg = ActorMessage::GetUniqueId {
            respond_to: send,
        };

        // Ignore send errors. If this send fails, so does the
        // recv.await below. There's no reason to check for the
        // same failure twice.
        let _ = self.sender.send(msg).await;
        recv.await.expect("Actor task has been killed")
    }
}
```
[full example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=1e60fb476843fb130db9034e8ead210c)

Let's take a closer look at the different pieces in this example.

**`ActorMessage.`** The `ActorMessage` enum defines the kind of messages we can
send to the actor. By using an enum, we can have many different message types,
and each message type can have its own set of arguments. We return a value to
the sender by using an [`oneshot`] channel, which is a message passing channel
that allows sending exactly one message.

In the example above, we match on the enum inside a `handle_message` method on
the actor struct, but that isn't the only way to structure this. One could also
match on the enum in the `run_my_actor` function. Each branch in this match
could then call various methods such as `get_unique_id` on the actor object.

**Errors when sending messages.** When dealing with channels, not all errors are
fatal.  Because of this, the example sometimes uses `let _ =` to ignore errors.
Generally a `send` operation on a channel fails if the receiver has been
dropped.

The first instance of this in our example is the line in the actor where we
respond to the message we were sent. This can happen if the receiver is no
longer interested in the result of the operation, e.g. if the task that sent
the message might have been killed.

**Shutdown of actor.** We can detect when the actor should shut down by looking
at failures to receive messages. In our example, this happens in the following
while loop:
```rust
while let Some(msg) = actor.receiver.recv().await {
    actor.handle_message(msg);
}
```
When all senders to the `receiver` have been dropped, we know that we will never
receive another message and can therefore shut down the actor. When this
happens, the call to `.recv()` returns `None`, and since it does not match the
pattern `Some(msg)`, the while loop exits and the function returns.

**`#[derive(Clone)]`** The `MyActorHandle` struct derives the `Clone` trait. It
can do this because [`mpsc`] means that it is a multiple-producer,
single-consumer channel. Since the channel allows multiple producers, we can
freely clone our handle to the actor, allowing us to talk to it from multiple
places.

## A run method on a struct

The example I gave above uses a top-level function that isn't defined on any
struct as the thing we spawn as a Tokio task, however many people find it more
natural to define a `run` method directly on the `MyActor` struct and spawn
that. This certainly works too, but the reason I give an example that uses a
top-level function is that it more naturally leads you towards the approach that
doesn't give you lots of lifetime issues.

To understand why, I have prepared an example of what people unfamiliar with the
pattern often come up with.
```rust
impl MyActor {
    fn run(&mut self) {
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            while let Some(msg) = self.receiver.recv().await {
                self.handle_message(msg);
            }
        });
    }

    pub async fn get_unique_id(&self) -> u32 {
        let (send, recv) = oneshot::channel();
        let msg = ActorMessage::GetUniqueId {
            respond_to: send,
        };

        // Ignore send errors. If this send fails, so does the
        // recv.await below. There's no reason to check for the
        // same failure twice.
        let _ = self.sender.send(msg).await;
        recv.await.expect("Actor task has been killed")
    }
}

... and no separate MyActorHandle
```
The two sources of trouble in this example are:

 1. The `tokio::spawn` call is inside `run`.
 2. The actor and the handle are the same struct.

The first issue causes problems because the `tokio::spawn` function requires the
argument to be `'static`. This means that the new task must own everything
inside it, which is a problem because the method borrows `self`, meaning that it
is not able to give away ownership of `self` to the new task.

The second issue causes problems because Rust enforces the single-ownership
principle. If you combine both the actor and the handle into a single struct,
you are (at least from the compiler's perspective) giving every handle access to
the fields owned by the actor's task. E.g. the `next_id` integer should be owned
only by the actor's task, and should not be directly accessible from any of the
handles.

That said, there is a version that works. By fixing the two above problems, you
end up with the following:
```rust
impl MyActor {
    async fn run(&mut self) {
        while let Some(msg) = self.receiver.recv().await {
            self.handle_message(msg);
        }
    }
}

impl MyActorHandle {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel(8);
        let actor = MyActor::new(receiver);
        tokio::spawn(async move { actor.run().await });

        Self { sender }
    }
}
```
This works identically to the top-level function. Note that, strictly speaking,
it is possible to write a version where the `tokio::spawn` is inside `run`, but
I don't recommend that approach.

## Variations on the theme

The actor I used as an example in this article uses the request-response
paradigm for the messages, but you don't have to do it this way. In this section
I will give some inspiration to how you can change the idea.

### No responses to messages

The example I used to introduce the concept includes a response to the messages
sent over a `oneshot` channel, but you don't always need a response at all. In
these cases there's nothing wrong with just not including the `oneshot` channel
in the message enum. When there's space in the channel, this will even allow you
to return from sending before the message has been processed.

You should still make sure to use a bounded channel so that the number of
messages waiting in the channel don't grow without bound. In some cases this
will mean that sending still needs to be an async function to handle the cases
where the `send` operation needs to wait for more space in the channel.

However there is an alternative to making `send` an async method. You can use
the `try_send` method, and handle sending failures by simply killing the actor.
This can be useful in cases where the actor is managing a `TcpStream`,
forwarding any messages you send into the connection. In this case, if writing
to the `TcpStream` can't keep up, you might want to just close the connection.

### Multiple handle structs for one actor

If an actor needs to be sent messages from different places, you can use
multiple handle structs to enforce that some message can only be sent from some
places.

When doing this you can still reuse the same `mpsc` channel internally, with an
enum that has all the possible message types in it. If you _do_ want to use
separate channels for this purpose, the actor can use [`tokio::select!`] to
receive from multiple channels at once.
```rs
loop {
    tokio::select! {
        Some(msg) = chan1.recv() => {
            // handle msg
        },
        Some(msg) = chan2.recv() => {
            // handle msg
        },
        else => break,
    }
}
```
You need to be careful with how you handle when the channels are closed, as
their `recv` method immediately returns `None` in this case. Luckily the
`tokio::select!` macro lets you handle this case by providing the pattern
`Some(msg)`. If only one channel is closed, that branch is disabled and the
other channel is still received from. When both are closed, the else branch runs
and uses `break` to exit from the loop.

[`tokio::select!`]: https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/macro.select.html

### Actors sending messages to other actors

There is nothing wrong with having actors send messages to other actors. To do
this, you can simply give one actor the handle of some other actor.

You need to be a bit careful if your actors form a cycle, because by holding on
to each other's handle structs, the last sender is never dropped, preventing
shutdown. To handle this case, you can have one of the actors have two handle
structs with separate `mpsc` channels, but with a `tokio::select!` that looks
like this:
```rs
loop {
    tokio::select! {
        opt_msg = chan1.recv() => {
            let msg = match opt_msg {
                Some(msg) => msg,
                None => break,
            };
            // handle msg
        },
        Some(msg) = chan2.recv() => {
            // handle msg
        },
    }
}
```
The above loop will always exit if `chan1` is closed, even if `chan2` is still
open. If `chan2` is the channel that is part of the actor cycle, this breaks the
cycle and lets the actors shut down.

An alternative is to simply call [`abort`] on one of the actors in the cycle.

[`abort`]: https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/task/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.abort

### Multiple actors sharing a handle

Just like you can have multiple handles per actor, you can also have multiple
actors per handle. The most common example of this is when handling a connection
such as a `TcpStream`, where you commonly spawn two tasks: one for reading and
one for writing. When using this pattern, you make the reading and writing tasks
as simple as you can — their only job is to do IO. The reader task will just
send any messages it receives to some other task, typically another actor, and
the writer task will just forward any messages it receives to the connection.

This pattern is very useful because it isolates the complexity associated with
performing IO, meaning that the rest of the program can pretend that writing
something to the connection happens instantly, although the actual writing
happens sometime later when the actor processes the message.

## Beware of cycles

I already talked a bit about cycles under the heading “Actors sending messages
to other actors”, where I discussed shutdown of actors that form a cycle.
However, shutdown is not the only problem that cycles can cause, because a cycle
can also result in a deadlock where each actor in the cycle is waiting for the
next actor to receive a message, but that next actor wont receive that message
until its next actor receives a message, and so on.

To avoid such a deadlock, you must make sure that there are no cycles of
channels with bounded capacity. The reason for this is that the `send` method on
a bounded channel does not return immediately. Channels whose `send` method
always returns immediately do not count in this kind of cycle, as you cannot
deadlock on such a `send`.

Note that this means that a oneshot channel cannot be part of a deadlocked
cycle, since their `send` method always returns immediately. Note also that if
you are using `try_send` rather than `send` to send the message, that also
cannot be part of the deadlocked cycle.

Thanks to [matklad](https://matklad.github.io/) for pointing out the issues
with cycles and deadlocks.
